# AYCOM Backend Fixes - Like, Bookmark, and Reply Count Issues

## Problem Summary
The like, bookmark, and reply count systems in the TweetCard component had the following issues:
1. **Likes were not being stored in the database** - only published to RabbitMQ
2. **Bookmark counts were not reflecting real server data** - API didn't return updated counts
3. **Reply counts were not displaying correct values** - API didn't return updated parent thread counts

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the backend API handlers in `social_handlers.go`:
- **LikeThread/UnlikeThread functions** only published events to RabbitMQ but never called the actual thread service
- **BookmarkThread/RemoveBookmark functions** called the thread service but didn't return updated counts
- **ReplyToThread function** didn't return updated parent thread counts after creating a reply

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Like Handlers (`social_handlers.go`)

#### Before:
```go
func LikeThread(c *gin.Context) {
    // Only published to RabbitMQ
    utils.PublishThreadLikedEvent(threadID, currentUserID, utils.EventData{
        "timestamp": time.Now(),
    })
    
    utils.SendSuccessResponse(c, http.StatusOK, gin.H{
        "message": "Thread liked successfully",
        "thread_id": threadID,
        "is_now_liked": true,
    })
}
```

#### After:
```go
func LikeThread(c *gin.Context) {
    // Get thread service client
    threadClient := GetThreadServiceClient()
    if threadClient == nil {
        utils.SendErrorResponse(c, http.StatusServiceUnavailable, "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", "Thread service unavailable")
        return
    }

    // Call thread service to like the thread
    err := threadClient.LikeThread(threadID, currentUserID)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle errors properly
        return
    }

    // Get updated thread data to return current counts
    thread, err := threadClient.GetThreadByID(threadID, currentUserID)
    
    // Publish event AND return updated counts
    response := gin.H{
        "message": "Thread liked successfully",
        "thread_id": threadID,
        "is_now_liked": true,
        "likes_count": thread.LikeCount,        // NEW: Return updated count
        "bookmark_count": thread.BookmarkCount,  // NEW: Return bookmark count
        "replies_count": thread.ReplyCount,      // NEW: Return reply count
        "is_bookmarked": thread.IsBookmarked,    // NEW: Return bookmark status
    }
    
    utils.SendSuccessResponse(c, http.StatusOK, response)
}
```

### 2. Fixed Unlike Handler
Similar changes to `UnlikeThread` function - now calls the thread service and returns updated counts.

### 3. Updated Bookmark Handlers
Enhanced `BookmarkThread` and `RemoveBookmark` functions to return updated counts:

```go
// Now returns updated thread data after bookmark operation
response := gin.H{
    "message": "Thread bookmarked successfully",
    "thread_id": threadID,
    "is_bookmarked": true,
    "likes_count": thread.LikeCount,
    "bookmark_count": thread.BookmarkCount,
    "replies_count": thread.ReplyCount,
    "is_liked": thread.IsLiked,
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Reply Handler
Updated `ReplyToThread` function to return updated parent thread counts:

```go
// After creating reply, get updated parent thread data
response := map[string]interface{}{
    "reply": resp.Reply,
    "updated_thread": map[string]interface{}{
        "thread_id": threadID,
        "likes_count": thread.LikeCount,
        "bookmark_count": thread.BookmarkCount,
        "replies_count": thread.ReplyCount,  // This will be incremented
        "is_liked": thread.IsLiked,
        "is_bookmarked": thread.IsBookmarked,
    },
}
```

## Frontend Compatibility
The frontend was already expecting these response fields:
- `response.likes_count` in like handlers
- `response.bookmark_count` in bookmark handlers
- Thread data structure with `likes_count`, `bookmark_count`, `replies_count`

## Testing Results
✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints are accessible and responding
✅ **Data Structure**: Threads contain all required count fields
✅ **Authentication**: Properly enforced for protected operations
✅ **Database Integration**: Like/bookmark operations now update the database
✅ **Count Updates**: API responses include updated counts for immediate UI updates

## Deployment
1. Backend changes have been applied to `social_handlers.go`
2. Docker container has been rebuilt and redeployed
3. API is running at `http://localhost:8083/api/v1/`

## How to Test
1. **Login to the application** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Like/unlike threads** - counts should update immediately and persist after page reload
3. **Bookmark/unbookmark threads** - counts should update immediately and persist
4. **Reply to threads** - parent thread reply counts should increment
5. **Verify persistence** - refresh the page and confirm counts remain correct

## Technical Details
- **Backend**: Go microservices architecture with gRPC communication
- **Frontend**: Svelte with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper transaction handling
- **Event System**: RabbitMQ for real-time notifications (preserved)
- **State Management**: Frontend store with optimistic updates + server confirmation

## Files Modified
- `backend/api-gateway/handlers/social_handlers.go` - Main fix location
- All other files remain unchanged (frontend was already compatible)

The system now properly:
1. Stores likes/bookmarks in the database
2. Returns updated counts in API responses  
3. Updates parent thread reply counts when replies are created
4. Maintains real-time event publishing for notifications
5. Provides immediate UI feedback with server-confirmed data
