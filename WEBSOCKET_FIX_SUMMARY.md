# WebSocket Chat System Stability Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Infinite Reconnection Loop in Message.svelte
**Problem**: Reactive statement causing constant reconnection attempts
```javascript
$: {
  if ($websocketStore) {
    const isWsConnected = $websocketStore.connected;
    if (!isWsConnected && selectedChat) {
      setTimeout(() => initializeWebSocketConnections(), 1000);
    }
  }
}
```

**Fix**: Replaced with simple monitoring without auto-reconnect
```javascript
$: {
  if ($websocketStore) {
    const isWsConnected = $websocketStore.connected;
    logger.debug(`WebSocket connection status: ${isWsConnected ? 'connected' : 'disconnected'}`);
  }
}
```

### 2. Duplicate onMount Handlers
**Problem**: Two onMount handlers causing multiple WebSocket connections
- First onMount: General initialization
- Second onMount: WebSocket-specific initialization

**Fix**: Removed duplicate onMount handler, consolidated initialization

### 3. Per-Chat Reconnection Counter Bug
**Problem**: Global reconnection counter instead of per-chat counters
```javascript
if (reconnectAttempts >= maxReconnectAttempts) // Using global counter
```

**Fix**: Properly implemented per-chat counters
```javascript
const currentAttempts = reconnectAttempts[chatId] || 0;
if (currentAttempts >= maxReconnectAttempts)
```

### 4. Connection Throttling
**Problem**: No protection against rapid connection attempts

**Fix**: Added 2-second throttling per chat
```javascript
const now = Date.now();
const lastAttempt = lastConnectionAttempt[chatId] || 0;
if (now - lastAttempt < 2000) {
  return; // Throttled
}
```

### 5. Overly Aggressive Connection Initialization
**Problem**: Connecting to multiple chats on component mount

**Fix**: Only connect when chat is actively selected
- Removed automatic connections to "recent chats"
- WebSocket connections now established in selectChat() function

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/pages/Message.svelte**
   - Removed infinite reconnection reactive statement
   - Removed duplicate onMount handler
   - Cleaned up WebSocket initialization logic

2. **frontend/src/stores/websocketStore.ts**
   - Fixed per-chat reconnection counters
   - Added connection throttling mechanism
   - Improved error handling and state management

## Docker Networking Configuration

The WebSocket URL building correctly handles different environments:
- **Local Development**: `ws://localhost:8083/api/v1/chats/:id/ws`
- **Docker Environment**: Uses container networking automatically
- **Production**: Adapts to HTTPS/WSS as needed

## Backend Route Verification

WebSocket endpoint confirmed at: `/api/v1/chats/:id/ws`
- Located in routes/routes.go line 154
- Part of publicWebsockets group (handles auth via query params)
- No JWT middleware in path (auth handled in WebSocket handler)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Manual Testing Steps
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in and navigate to Messages
3. Select different chats and observe:
   - No repeated connection attempts in console
   - Single WebSocket connection per chat
   - Proper reconnection behavior on network issues

### 2. Browser Console Monitoring
Look for these indicators of success:
- No rapid "Connecting to WebSocket for chat..." messages
- No "Connection throttled" messages under normal use
- Clear connection/disconnection logging

### 3. Network Tab Analysis
- Single WebSocket connection per active chat
- No repeated connection attempts
- Proper upgrade to WebSocket protocol

### 4. Stress Testing
- Switch between chats rapidly
- Temporarily disable network and re-enable
- Leave page idle to test connection maintenance

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Single Connection**: Only one WebSocket connection per active chat
2. **Controlled Reconnection**: Max 10 attempts with exponential backoff
3. **No Infinite Loops**: Reactive statements don't trigger constant reconnects
4. **Throttled Connections**: Minimum 2 seconds between connection attempts
5. **Per-Chat Management**: Independent connection state per chat

## Monitoring and Debugging

Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Connection attempts and results
- Throttling actions
- Reconnection attempts with attempt count
- Connection state changes

Use browser console to monitor WebSocket behavior and ensure stability.

## Production Deployment Notes

1. Ensure Docker Compose services are running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Verify API Gateway accessibility:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:8083/api/v1
   ```

3. Monitor logs for WebSocket connections:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f api_gateway
   ```

4. Test WebSocket connectivity with browser dev tools Network tab

## Performance Improvements

The fixes should result in:
- Reduced CPU usage (no infinite loops)
- Lower network traffic (fewer connection attempts)
- Better user experience (stable real-time messaging)
- Improved debugging (cleaner console output)
