# 🖼️ Mock Images & Media Overlay Testing

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Added "Trigger Mock Images" Button
- **Location**: ThreadDetail page, next to the "Reply to this thread" button
- **Functionality**: Adds 3 mock images to the current thread for testing
- **Mock Images**: Uses random images from Picsum Photos (800x600, 800x700, 900x600)

### 2. Fixed Scrolling Issue
- **Problem**: Page was not scrollable
- **Solution**: Added `overflow-y: auto` to the main container
- **Result**: Page is now properly scrollable

### 3. Media Overlay Navigation Testing
- **Focus**: Navigation between multiple media items
- **Test Cases**: 3 mock images for testing navigation arrows
- **Features**: Previous/Next navigation, media counter (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Trigger Mock Images
1. Navigate to any thread detail page (e.g., `/thread/1`)
2. Look for the pink "🖼️ Trigger Mock Images" button next to "Reply to this thread"
3. Click the button
4. Success toast will appear: "Mock images added! Click on any image to test the overlay."

### Step 2: Test Media Overlay
1. After triggering mock images, you'll see 3 images in the thread
2. Click on any image to open the media overlay
3. Test navigation:
   - Use ← → arrow keys to navigate
   - Use Previous/Next buttons in the overlay
   - Observe the counter showing current image (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)

### Step 3: Test Interactions
1. While in overlay, test all mock interaction buttons:
   - ❤️ Like button
   - 💬 Reply button  
   - 🔄 Repost button
   - 📌 Bookmark button
   - 📤 Share button
   - ⬇️ Download button

### Step 4: Test Closing
1. Press ESC key to close overlay
2. Click X button to close overlay
3. Click outside the image to close overlay

## 🎯 TESTING FOCUS AREAS

### ✅ Media Navigation
- **Previous/Next arrows**: Navigate between 3 mock images
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys work properly
- **Counter display**: Shows "1 / 3", "2 / 3", "3 / 3"
- **Smooth transitions**: Images change smoothly

### ✅ Overlay Interactions
- **Mock buttons respond**: All buttons show console logs when clicked
- **Theme compatibility**: Works in both light and dark themes
