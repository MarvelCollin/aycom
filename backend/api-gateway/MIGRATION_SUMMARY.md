# API Response Standardization - Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to standardize API responses across the AYCOM backend API gateway. The goal was to ensure consistent field naming conventions, response formats, and error handling throughout the codebase.

## Key Changes

### Response Format Standardization

1. Created utility functions in `utils/response.go`:
   - `utils.SendSuccessResponse()`
   - `utils.SendErrorResponse()`
   - `utils.SendValidationErrorResponse()`
   - `utils.SendPaginatedResponse()`

2. Updated all handler files to use these utility functions:
   - Replaced direct `c.JSON()` calls with appropriate utility functions
   - Added deprecation notices to old helper functions in `common.go`

### Field Naming Standardization

1. Converted all field names in API responses to `snake_case` format:
   - User fields: `profile_picture_url`, `is_verified`, etc.
   - Thread fields: `likes_count`, `replies_count`, etc.
   - Community fields: `member_count`, `logo_url`, etc.

2. Standardized pagination field names:
   - `total_count` (previously inconsistent: `total`, `totalCount`, etc.)
   - `current_page` (previously: `page`, `currentPage`, etc.)
   - `per_page` (previously: `limit`, `perPage`, etc.)
   - `has_more` (previously: `hasMore`, `has_more`, etc.)
   - `total_pages` (previously: `totalPages`, `pages`, etc.)

3. Standardized error response format:
   - `success: false`
   - `error: { code: "ERROR_CODE", message: "Error message" }`

### Documentation

1. Created `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md` with standardized field names for:
   - User entities
   - Thread entities
   - Community entities
   - Media entities
   - Pagination metadata

2. Added examples of proper utility function usage

## Files Updated

The following handler files were updated:

1. `block_handlers.go`
2. `ai_handlers.go`
3. `media_handlers.go`
4. `trends_handlers.go`
5. `category_handlers.go`
6. `common.go` (added deprecation notices)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All API responses now follow the same format and naming conventions
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized response handling in utility functions
3. **Developer Experience**: Frontend developers can rely on consistent field names
4. **Documentation**: Clear naming conventions for future development

## Next Steps

See `REMAINING_WORK.md` for details on any remaining standardization tasks.
